    <p>In my free time, I like to make and play <strong>video games</strong>. My favorite game of all time is <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/" title="Overwatch" target="_blank">Overwatch</a>,
        I loved it so much I chose to go work for <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/" title="Blizzard Entertainment" target="_blank">Blizzard Entertainment </a> !
